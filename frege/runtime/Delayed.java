/**
 * <p> Base class for lazy values.</p>
 *
 * <p> Functions will create instances of subclasses of {@link Delayed} once
 * all arguments got applied. Note that all other classes implementing {@link Lazy}
 * are pseudo-lazy, where the {@link Lazy#call} method is the identity. This
 * is to avoid needless wrappings and conversions. </p> 
 *
 * <p> Lazy values differ from proper values insofar as they need to know
 * how to exactly evaluate themselves.
 * This is the job of the {@link Delayed#call} and {@link Delayed#eval} functions. </p>

 * <p> The functionality of {@link Delayed#call} is fixed through <tt>final</tt>
 * and cannot be changed. It is in some sense the heart of the runtime, as it provides
 * support for tail calls and lazy evaluation. </p>
 * 
 * <p>{@link Delayed#call} repeatedly invokes {@link Delayed#eval} until the value is 
 * in <i>weak head normal form</i>, which is signalled by not being an instance of {@link Delayed}.
 * In addition, the result is shared through 
 * caching it in a private instance variable. Hence, instances of
 * {@link Delayed} are not immutable and this in turn requires synchronization.</p>

 * <p> The caching of the evaluated value would not be strictly necessary, as
 * repeated evaluation must always yield the same result. Experience shows,
 * however, that re-evaluations are quite common, hence not caching the result
 * would most likely cause even the simplest program to perform unacceptably bad.
 * </p>

 * <p> The real work, then, is done by {@link Delayed#eval}. It may return a proper value or
 * another lazy value, though it is required that the latter is somehow closer
 * to the final result, so that evaluation of that value gets even closer
 * and repeated evaluation of the indermediate lazy values
 * eventually reaches the result. </p>
 *
 * <h3> Introduction of lazyness in frege compiled code </h3>
 *
 * <p>This version of the frege runtime can support a mostly eager execution
 * where all functions are strict in all arguments by default 
 * and data constructors are strict in all arguments that are not recursive.</p>
 * 
 * <p> Delayed values are introduced at only 2 occasions: </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>  Delayed arguments of data constructors or functions. Take the following example: </p>
 * <pre><code>
 * -- the list of fibonacci numbers
 * fibs = 0:1:zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p> The second argument of (:) is lazy because its type is recursive. 
 * Types of constructor arguments are said to be recursive, if they mention a type 
 * that depends on the type of the constructed value.
 * A type depends on itself and on types that mention it in at least one constructor argument. 
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Hence, the application of <tt>zipWith</tt> argument may appear in code like this:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 * new Delayed() {
 *     final public TList eval() {
 * 	        return zipWith(plusFunc, fibs, tail(fibs));
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p> Non-recursive tail calls. </p>
 * <p> If the return value of a function is expressed as a function call,
 * we call this a <em>tail call</em>. If a function tail-calls itself, this is
 * <em>tail recursion</em>. Here are examples: </p>
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * even 0 = true
 * even n = odd  (n-1)
 * odd  0 = false
 * odd  n = even (n-1)
 * factorial n | n &gt;= 0 = helper 1 n where
 *    helper r 0 = r
 *    helper r n = helper (r*n) (n-1)
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p> Function "helper" is tail recursive and will be compiled to a while loop.
 * Functions "factorial", "even" and "odd", however, employ tail calls.
 * In "factorial", this is not a problem, it just sets up parameters for the
 * very efficient "helper" function, thus we can expect a maximum stack depth of 2
 * no matter what the value of "n" is.</p>
 * <p> Things are different with "even" and "odd" that would need stack space
 * proportional to the value of their argument if implemented naively.
 * But frege functions may simply return their tail call in the form of
 * a {@link Delayed} object instead of actually evaluating it themselves. This way, a long
 * series of tail calls can be converted to a while loop, see {@link Delayed#call}. </p>
 * <p>Unfortunately, this does not work in every case. Take the even/odd exmple in a slightly
 * changed form:</p>
 * <pre>
 * even 0 = true
 * even 1 = false
 * even n = odd  (n-1)
 * odd  n = !(even n)
 * </pre>
 * This will very soon run out of stack space with greater n. To see why, imagine <tt>even 5</tt>
 * had to be evaluated.
 * <pre>
 * even 5 = odd 4               by 3rd rule of even
 * odd 4 = !(even 4)            by definition of odd
 * !(even 4) = !(odd 3)         by 3rd rule of even
 * !(odd 3)  = !(!(even 3))
 * !(!(even 3)) = !(!(odd 2))
 * !(!(odd 2))  = !(!(!(even 2)))
 * !(!(!(even 2))) = !(!(!(odd 1)))
 * !(!(!(odd 1))) = !(!(!(!(even 0))))
 * !(!(!(!(even 0)))) = !(!(!(!true)))
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Because ! must first know the value to negate it must evaluate its argument
 * before it returns. Hence, evaluation of (odd n) results in n nested negations, i.e. in
 * a stack depth of n.
 * </p>
 * <p>This effect happens always when the recursion is done indirectly in an
 * argument of a strict function. Another well-known case is the naive implementation
 * of a function that tells a lists's length:</p>
 * <pre>
 * naiveLength [] = 0
 * naiveLength (_:as) = 1 + naiveLength as
 * </pre>
 * <p>Here, the recursion takes place in the 2nd argument of the addition.
 * To add 1 to something, one must first know to what, hence the
 * whole list must be consulted before even the first addition 
 * can take place.</p>
 * <p>Compare the better implementation:</p>
 * <pre>
 * length xs = helper xs 0
 *    where
 *       helper []     !count = count
 *       helper (_:as) !count = helper as (count+1)
 * </pre>
 * Here, only tail call recursion takes place and because counter is strict, the increment
 * will be evaluated in each loop.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
